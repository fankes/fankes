# Project Maintenance Plan

This document will showcase the projects I am currently maintaining and the plans for open-source projects.

I am involved in maintaining projects for other companies, so I may not have enough time to maintain open-source projects.

![Basic Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Basic%20Status-Slow%20Maintenance-yellow)

The project was created for dynamic dependency updates and YAML-friendly human-readable configuration files. For now, only periodic dependency updates are done. Due to limited energy and the need to write an IDEA plugin, and the official Version Catalog being very mature, I am not very keen on continuing maintenance.

The project aims to provide a convenient API and module development environment for Xposed developers. Currently, the project is preparing for the 2.0.0 plan. Due to LSPosed being closed-source and the continuous adjustment of the libxposed (new API) plan, and my lack of interest in continuing Xposed module development and being busy with work, only periodic dependency updates are done for now. (If anyone is willing to take over the new design ideas in the 2.0.0 plan, please contact me for collaboration)

This project is being prepared for refactoring. The previous design concepts had many issues. Refactoring will be done gradually during my free time. For now, only periodic dependency updates are done.

Currently, QQ and WeChat have already made relevant functional adjustments. The initial power consumption issue has been resolved by themselves. Additionally, these apps now support push services, so they no longer need to stay in the background. Now it is just a cyber power-saving module that kills power locks. However, it is still effective for those who prefer older versions. Some issues remain unresolved. Due to being busy with work, only periodic dependency updates are done for now.
