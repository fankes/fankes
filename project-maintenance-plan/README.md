# Project Maintenance Plan

This document will showcase the projects I am currently maintaining and the plans for open-source projects.

I am involved in maintaining projects for other companies, so I may not have enough time to maintain open-source projects.

![Basic Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Basic%20Status-Normal%20Maintenance-blue?style=for-the-badge)

The original intention of this project is to provide a convenient API and module development environment for the majority of Xposed developers. The project is still preparing for the 2.0.0 plan. Since the new version of LSPosed has been in internal testing, and the libxposed (new API) plan continues to be adjusted. In addition, I don’t really want to continue to engage in the development of Xposed modules and my busy work, I will only maintain basic functions and regularly rely on structure updates.(If you have any developers who are willing to discuss the new design ideas in the 2.0.0 plan together in the later stage, you can contact me to cooperate)

Currently, QQ and WeChat have already made relevant functional adjustments. The initial power consumption issue has been resolved by themselves. Additionally, these apps now support push services, so they no longer need to stay in the background. Now it is just a cyber power-saving module that kills power locks. However, it is still effective for those who prefer older versions. Some issues remain unresolved. Due to being busy with work, only periodic dependency updates are done for now.
